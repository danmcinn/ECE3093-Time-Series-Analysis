# 1. Introduction: Why study time series?

Time series are ubiquitous in many areas of business, academia, government and industry because we now collect data for almost *everything*. Anytime a series of measurements is taken over a period of time, a time series in generated. Examples include, yearly wheat harvest in tonnes for the past 100 years, the average grade for students in a perticular course over the past ten years, and so on. In electrical engineering, you may have signal amplitude sampled at a certain rate over a one minute period.

The interesting thing for us is that the mathematical analysis of these time series remains largely the same, although some time series are much more difficult to analyse than others. In this course we will deal with the simplest class of time series, which are those that can be modeled as Autoregressive Moving Average (ARMA) processes.
